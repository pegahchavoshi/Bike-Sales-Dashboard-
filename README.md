### Introduction
In this project, I created a comprehensive Bike Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provided valuable insights into the sales of bikes based on various factors such as gender, income, age, and commute distance. By analyzing these trends and patterns, I gained a deeper understanding of our customers and made informed business decisions.

### Data Cleaning
To ensure accurate analysis, I began by cleaning the raw data. I added filters to the table to facilitate data cleaning and removed duplicates using the Remove Duplicates feature. I standardized the values in the Gender column to Married and Single and changed the values in the Gender column to Female and Male for consistency. I simplified the Income column by decreasing the decimal places to enhance readability. Finally, I created a new column called Age Brackets and used the IF statement to categorize the ages into meaningful groups.

### Pivot Tables
To facilitate data analysis, I built pivot tables with the raw data. I selected the relevant columns and data to work with and changed the value section from SUM to AVERAGE to calculate the average income per purchase. I created a pivot table to analyze the commute distance and identified any patterns or trends. I also created a pivot table to analyze the age brackets and gained insights into the age demographics of our customers.

### Charts and Visualizations
To visualize the data, I created charts and visualizations. I created a chart to visualize the average income per purchase and added a data table to enhance readability. I also created charts to analyze the commute distance and age brackets. I copied the visualized charts to the dashboard tab and formatted them to enhance readability and aesthetics.

### Dashboard
To create a professional and polished look, I removed gridlines and added a header to the dashboard. I added filters to the dashboard for marital status, income, and age brackets to facilitate data analysis and gain deeper insights into our customers.

### Conclusion
The Bike Sales Dashboard provided a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the sales trends and patterns of the customers. By analyzing the data, I gained valuable insights into the customers' demographics, preferences, and behaviors ti make informed business decisions. The dashboard was designed to be user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and professional, and served as a valuable tool for the business.
