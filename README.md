# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-
Analyzing Sales Trends and Patterns

### Introduction
In this project, I created a comprehensive Bike Sales Dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The dashboard provided valuable insights into the sales of bikes based on various factors such as gender, income, age, and commute distance. By analyzing these trends and patterns, I gained a deeper understanding of our customers and made informed business decisions.
### Dashboard Overview

#### Gender and Income
The dashboard revealed that people who had a little bit more money were buying bikes, and men were making more money in this dataset overall. The average income for females who did not buy a bike was $53,000, while the average income for males who did not buy a bike was $56,000. For those who bought bikes, females had an average income of $55,000, while males had an average income of $60,000. This suggests that income plays a significant role in bike purchases, and men tend to buy more bikes than women.
#### Commute Distance
The dashboard also revealed that the distance of the commute has an impact on bike purchases. The pivot table analyzing the commute distance showed that people who lived closer to their workplace were more likely to buy a bike. For example, people who lived less than 5 miles away from their workplace were more likely to buy a bike than those who lived more than 10 miles away. This suggests that people who live closer to their workplace are more likely to consider biking as a viable transportation option.
#### Region
The dashboard also revealed that region has an impact on bike purchases. The pivot table analyzing the region showed that people in certain regions were more likely to buy a bike than others. For example, people in the West region were more likely to buy a bike than those in the East region. This suggests that regional factors such as climate, terrain, and infrastructure may influence bike purchases.

### Data Cleaning
To ensure accurate analysis, I began by cleaning the raw data. I added filters to the table to facilitate data cleaning and removed duplicates using the Remove Duplicates feature. I standardized the values in the Gender column to Married and Single and changed the values in the Gender column to Female and Male for consistency. I simplified the Income column by decreasing the decimal places to enhance readability. Finally, I created a new column called Age Brackets and used the IF statement to categorize the ages into meaningful groups.

### Pivot Tables
To facilitate data analysis, I built pivot tables with the raw data. I selected the relevant columns and data to work with and changed the value section from SUM to AVERAGE to calculate the average income per purchase. I created a pivot table to analyze the commute distance and identified any patterns or trends. I also created a pivot table to analyze the age brackets and gained insights into the age demographics of our customers.

### Charts and Visualizations
To visualize the data, I created charts and visualizations. I created a chart to visualize the average income per purchase and added a data table to enhance readability. I also created charts to analyze the commute distance and age brackets. I copied the visualized charts to the dashboard tab and formatted them to enhance readability and aesthetics.

### Dashboard
To create a professional and polished look, I removed gridlines and added a header to the dashboard. I added filters to the dashboard for marital status, income, and age brackets to facilitate data analysis and gain deeper insights into our customers.

### Conclusion
The Bike Sales Dashboard provided a comprehensive and detailed analysis of the sales trends and patterns of the customers. By analyzing the data, I gained valuable insights into the customers' demographics, preferences, and behaviors to make informed business decisions. The analysis revealed that income and gender play a significant role in bike purchases, with men and people with higher incomes being more likely to buy bikes. The analysis also showed that the distance of the commute and region have an impact on bike purchases, with people who live closer to their workplace and those in certain regions being more likely to buy a bike. These insights can help us make informed business decisions and tailor our marketing strategies to better target our customers.
